# Shape tool
This is a tool for automatically generating basic geometrical 2D primitives (circles, squares, rectangles, ellipsis, etc) in different visual styles.
This shapes are output as a JPEG file and JSON file describing the shapes.

This tool is used for generating endless data for machine learning algorithms to learn to identify these primitives.
Noise can also be added to harden the task of detection.

## JSON format specification
